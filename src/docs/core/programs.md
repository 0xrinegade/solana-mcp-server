# Programs

Programs on Solana are executable code deployed to the blockchain that process instructions and manage state through accounts.

## Program Characteristics
- Stateless execution
- Deterministic behavior
- No direct access to external data
- Limited compute budget
- Upgradeable (optional)
- Written in Rust, C++, or other languages that compile to BPF

## Program Development
1. Entry Point
   - process_instruction function
   - Receives program_id, accounts, instruction_data
   - Single entry point for all instructions

2. Account Management
   - Validate account ownership
   - Check account permissions
   - Handle account data
   - Manage PDAs

3. Instruction Processing
   - Deserialize instruction data
   - Validate parameters
   - Execute business logic
   - Update account state
   - Handle errors appropriately

## Program Deployment
1. Build program
2. Generate program address
3. Deploy to blockchain
4. Initialize program state
5. Verify deployment

## Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs
- Check account ownership
- Verify signer privileges
- Handle errors gracefully
- Protect against reentrancy
- Validate account relationships
- Implement access controls

## Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- Programs can call other programs
- Invoke with signed or unsigned accounts
- Pass through signers
- Handle return data
- Manage compute budget

## Program Upgrades
- Optional upgrade authority
- Careful state migration
- Backward compatibility
- Testing upgrade paths
- Managing dependencies

## Best Practices
1. Code Organization
   - Modular instruction handling
   - Clear error definitions
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation

2. State Management
   - Efficient data structures
   - Proper serialization
   - Account validation
   - Error handling

3. Security
   - Input validation
   - Ownership checks
   - Signer verification
   - Reentrancy protection

4. Performance
   - Minimize compute usage
   - Optimize account lookups
   - Efficient data structures
   - Smart batching

## Testing
1. Unit Tests
   - Instruction logic
   - State management
   - Error conditions

2. Integration Tests
   - Cross-program interaction
   - Transaction building
   - State verification

3. Security Tests
   - Access control
   - Edge cases
   - Attack vectors
