# Solana Deployment Guide

This guide covers the deployment process for Solana programs and applications.

## Program Deployment

### 1. Build Process
```bash
# Build program
cargo build-bpf

# Verify binary
solana program dump target/deploy/program.so
```

### 2. Deployment Steps
```bash
# Deploy to devnet
solana program deploy target/deploy/program.so

# Verify deployment
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>

# Check program logs
solana logs <PROGRAM_ID>
```

### 3. Upgrade Process
```bash
# Set upgrade authority
solana program set-upgrade-authority <PROGRAM_ID> --new-upgrade-authority <NEW_AUTHORITY>

# Deploy upgrade
solana program deploy --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> target/deploy/program.so
```

## Environment Setup

### 1. Development Environment
```bash
# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Setup test wallet
solana-keygen new -o deploy-keypair.json
```

### 2. Staging Environment
```bash
# Configure for testnet
solana config set --url https://api.testnet.solana.com

# Setup staging wallet
solana-keygen new -o staging-keypair.json
```

### 3. Production Environment
```bash
# Configure for mainnet
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Setup production wallet
solana-keygen new -o production-keypair.json
```

## Deployment Checklist

### 1. Pre-deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment keys secured

### 2. Deployment
- [ ] Build verified
- [ ] Program size optimized
- [ ] Upgrade authority set
- [ ] Initial state configured
- [ ] Deployment verified

### 3. Post-deployment
- [ ] Functionality verified
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Documentation published

## Security Considerations

### 1. Key Management
- Secure key storage
- Access control
- Key rotation procedures
- Backup procedures

### 2. Program Security
- Program verification
- Upgrade authority
- Access controls
- Emergency procedures

### 3. Operational Security
- RPC endpoint security
- Monitoring setup
- Incident response
- Backup procedures

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Program Monitoring
```bash
# Setup program logging
solana logs <PROGRAM_ID>

# Monitor transactions
solana transaction-history <PROGRAM_ID>
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Transaction throughput
- Compute unit usage
- Account access patterns
- Error rates

### 3. Alert Setup
- Error thresholds
- Performance alerts
- Security alerts
- System health

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Program Updates
```bash
# Build new version
cargo build-bpf

# Deploy update
solana program deploy --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> target/deploy/program.so

# Verify update
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>
```

### 2. State Migration
- Data validation
- Migration scripts
- Rollback procedures
- Testing procedures

### 3. Emergency Procedures
- Critical bug fixes
- Security patches
- Emergency shutdown
- Recovery procedures
